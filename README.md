## üìÇ Projects

### Interactive Brokers Websocket Connection
Engineered a production-grade real-time options data pipeline leveraging Python's asyncio and websockets for concurrent I/O operations, processing 50+ messages/sec from Interactive Brokers WebSocket API with intelligent contract filtering (3.5% ATM strike range, 3 nearest expirations). 

Architected a multi-worker message processing system (4 parallel workers with asyncio.Queue) implementing priority-based message routing, LRU caching (@lru_cache with 10K entry capacity) for field parsing optimization, and connection pooling (aiohttp sessions) for API efficiency. 

Data pipeline outputs structured time-series data to Polars DataFrames with explicit schema enforcement (17 typed columns: Greeks, IV, volume, OI, bid/ask), persisted incrementally to Parquet format (pyarrow) with 15-minute file rotation boundaries. 

Implemented comprehensive data quality controls including regex-compiled field cleaners, NaN handling, and automated schema validation. Performance monitoring includes real-time metrics tracking (msg/sec throughput, queue saturation, cache hit rates >90%, dropped message counts) with 30-second interval logging for operational observability.


### Automated Cryptocurrency Trading Bot for ByBit
Engineered an automated cryptocurrency trading system on ByBit leveraging Python with Polars for high-performance data transformations and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) via hmmlearn for probabilistic regime detection. 

Designed a multi-stage data pipeline integrating REST API data ingestion, real-time feature engineering (LDPM indicators, ATR, EMA), and Discord webhook-based approval workflows with asynchronous I/O. 

Implemented enterprise-grade risk controls including position sizing algorithms, trailing stop management, and exchange state synchronization, while maintaining comprehensive logging and error handling for production resilience.
